Pay close attention to the instructions provided throughout the game, as they will guide you on how to master new skills and overcome increasingly difficult challenges.

As you journey deeper into the jungle, you'll encounter various interactable elements. Not every object on the screen can be interacted with; only those that stand out and appear distinct from the background are interactable. Be careful not to try and climb on something that isnâ€™t there!
